Brief description: 
  Drive a player 'missile' into gold to maximise score.
  Avoid or destroy rock obstacles for minor score, and collect powerups to fire projectiles that can blow up gold.

Keystrokes: 
  Spacebar: Proceed through menus OR fire laser during game.
  W: Move up
  S: Move down
  A: Fire projectile (if you have at least 1 ammo from powerups)

Known bugs:
  In JOptionPane, if one clicks 'cancel' or X you will freeze the game with the below error:
    "NumberFormatException: Cannot parse null string"
  FYI if you explode, you lose any ammo you hadn't used. That's intentional.
